# SeutuMassa service

SeutuMassa is an Oskari-based tool for managing land masses. SeutuMassa is run by Helsinki Region Environmental Services HSY.

## How is Oskari used?

The SeutuMassa map service allows the end user to view land masses in the Helsinki metropolitan area: where the landmasses are located and where the excess is transported.

The service makes land mass management easier and more efficient. SeutuMassa helps to reduce environmental impact by giving information of nearby land masses. Therefore, it enables shorter transport distances and increased utilization of recyclable masses. For example, the city of Vantaa has used the information in their planning of Light rail. 

The visibility of map layers and the available functionalities are based on user roles. Some of the map layers and functionalities are limited, for example, for the workers of municipalities of the area.

SeutuMassa has been developed to include better tools for reports and a customized search for different soil types.

## Who is the map service for?

The people responsible for land mass management and planning in the Helsinki metropolitan area and those who need land mass data.
