# The Southwest Finland Map Service

Lounaistieto is a regional information service in Southwest Finland. The service is run by several organisations in the region, including the city of Turku and the Regional council of Southwest Finland. The coordinating and administering of the service is done by Lounaistieto.

## How is Oskari used?

The map service was implemented as a basic Oskari instance in 2015 to share information and datasets of the region. There are hundreds of spatial datasets on a wide range of topics available for viewing from southwest Finland. All the datasets are published in the main public Oskari instance with the PostGIS database and GeoServer in the background.

Even though the map service is the basic Oskari "out of the box", the map publishing functionality has been in heavy use. The registered users are allowed to create their own map publications and embed them on their websites. There are also map services / publications that are built upon the main service using the map publishing tool. Some of these are created by the Regional council of Southwest Finland:

#### Virma 

The latest map service that is done using map publishing functionality of The Soutwest Finland Map Service is Virma. Virma includes information on parks, outdoor areas and different amenities and routes of the area. The service is an RPC implementation of Oskari that has been developed with mobile use in mind.

#### Water protection areas

Other map publications include a map service of water protection areas, made for the professionals in water protection at The Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment and the Regional council of Southwest Finland. The service includes datasets only for their use.

#### Waste management

A waste management map service has been implemented for the city of Turku. The map service allows the end users to find out where the closest waste management services are in their area.
