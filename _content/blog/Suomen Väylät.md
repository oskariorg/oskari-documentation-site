# Suomen Väylät

Suomen Väylät is a map service provided by the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency.

## How is Oskari used?

The service was launched in 2022 and it currently contains more than 270 data types and their attributes. The service and its contents are continuously developed. 

The Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency's public Oskari instance is a heavily customized RPC instance, meaning that it is a created using Oskari's map publishing tool and then developed further. The service has a new management tool to tag different layers and other groups which makes sorting datasets easier. The tool allows creating maps on different themes, for example, all the datasets that are related to railway networks can be found and viewed easily.

Suomen Väylät allows viewing road data on the state-owned road network, rail data and waterway data. Data on infrastructure projects of the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency, and the data types of Digiroad (National Road and Street Database) are also included as separate datasets. The service contains several thematic maps, such as a project map and the Finnish Railway Network Statement. The end user can also draw different shapes, use markers and download maps from the service. The map service also has separate search functionalities for address, road and metadata.

## Who is the map service for?

Anyone who wants to view and download spatial data sets related to the road, rail and waterway network.
