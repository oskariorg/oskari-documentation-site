# Finnish Food Authority

Several mapping tools produced by the Finnish Food Authority use Oskari as a map component. These include e.g. the map service at Kalastusrajoitus.fi (The Fishing Restriction Service).

## How is Oskari used?

The detailed information is shown as an embedded map created from Suomi.fi maps (using Oskari RPC). Suomi.fi maps is an Oskari-based map service for public sector authorities in Finland.

The Fishing Restriction Service contains information on which areas are outside general fishing rights. The service includes water areas where angling, ice fishing and lure fishing have been restricted by the Fishing Act and decisions of the ELY Centres. The authority has marked migratory fish waters in the service based on current information.

The map service also contains the protected water areas under the Nature Conservation Act, fishing restrictions to protect the Saimaa ringed seal, other fishing restrictions for migratory fish waters, the new decisions by ELY Centres (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) restricting fishing in accordance with the Fishing Act, and areas where fishing is regulated by the fishing rules of local border rivers.

## Who is the map service for?

The map service is open for anyone to use.
