# 3.1.0 is here!

The new version was released 29th of September and it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oskariorg) and Oskari.org Maven repository. The sample application package has been updated on [the download page](https://oskari.org/download) and [the OSGeo website](https://download.osgeo.org/oskari/). As always you can take a peek at the latest release at **https://demo.oskari.org/**

## Many library updates

The release doesn’t have many visible changes for end-users, but has:

-	plenty of library updates
-	some tuning for mobile/touch-based devices
-	bunch of refactoring for the publisher functionality that just missed the last release (like a hook for other bundles to add panels to publisher UI)
-	couple of new things for RPC-based apps
-	other smaller fixes and tunings

Upgrading from 3.0.x should be straight-forward by just bumping up the version number for your Oskari-based application. No extra manual migration steps required.
