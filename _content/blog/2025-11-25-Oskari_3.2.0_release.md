# Oskari 3.2.0 is out!

The new version was released 25th of November. The version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oskariorg) and Oskari.org Maven repository. The sample application package has been updated on [the download page](https://oskari.org/download) and [the OSGeo website](https://download.osgeo.org/oskari/). As always you can take a peek at the latest release at **https://demo.oskari.org/**

## React 16 to 18 and other library updates

Like the previous release, this version comes with plenty of library updates - 14 in total.

It should be noted that the React version update requires some modifications to current code for any app specific bundles. See [React migration guide for details](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide). A quick guide for migrating most bundles can be found in [the release notes of 3.2.0](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-frontend/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md).

## Other changes and upgrading

This release includes a preview of a new bundle myfeatures that can be used in place of the userlayer functionality (myplacesimport). This functionality will replace myplaces and userlayer functionalities in the future with migrations from those data types to myfeatures. The functionality from user perspective is the same as userlayer today, but the internal code has been rewritten on both frontend and server.

3.2.0 also comes with improved developer experience as bundle loader changes that were started on 3.0 continue. Now only the jQuery-based ui-components packages remain on the old loader.

Upgrading from 3.1.x requires some/minor code changes for your Oskari-based application (bundle reference/loader changes on main.js). And as mentioned above, any application specific React-based bundles will require some changes because of the React-upgrade as well. These are documented on the release notes.
