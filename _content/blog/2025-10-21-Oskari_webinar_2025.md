# Oskari Webinar: The basics of Oskari 7.11.2025 12:00 - 14:00 (GMT +2)

**[The recordings of the webinar can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm9Rnww71mUt7BerYN92bt9E6FRW9jJF3)**

What is Oskari? How does it work? How would my organisation benefit from using Oskari? Join us for a webinar aimed for those who have little or no prior experience with Oskari. We will present the possibilities of Oskari for end-users, admins and developers.

With Oskari you can implement a geospatial service that can be used on your web browser either via PC or a mobile device. With Oskari you can show you map layers by various different organizations, restrict the access to certain layers only to users with certain rights and publish desired maps to other web sites as embedded maps.
