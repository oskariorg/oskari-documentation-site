# Improvements to Oskari 3.0: frontend 3.0.1 and server 3.0.2

The Oskari 3.0 major release came just in March and now we have a couple of minor updates. The latest versions are now 3.0.1 for oskari-frontend and 3.0.2 for oskari-server.

The updates include bug fixes for both server and frontend. A couple of dependencies of frontend were also updated. The latest server versions fix, for example, an error where publishing new "my places" layers as layers on embedded maps couldn't be done. For the full list of changes, see the release notes for [oskari-frontend](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-frontend/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md) and [oskari-server](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-server/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md).

These updates have been running in production on several services for some time now. We recommend updating, if it hasn't been done already.
